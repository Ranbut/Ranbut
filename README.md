### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my profile in Github

I am curious, daring programmer who enjoys what he does. I have knowledge with C#(.net), Python, as well as Fullstack programming with HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, Node.js and React. Made a technical course in Digital Games Programming and currently studying Computer Science. I intend to start posting my projects, but I'm short on time, but I'm trying and I'll get it even if it takes time.

Here's my profile on:
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-gabriel-do-carmo-alves-da-silva-7148901b3/?locale=en_US), for my qualifications.
* [Itch.io](https://ranbut.itch.io), for my games(if there is any yet).
